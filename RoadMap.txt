Ideas for application:
----------------------
 * inventory interaction is not working yet
 * move API to azure (there is a cost )
 * CI/CD process (unit tests)
 * Deploy desktop app to blob storage for download
 * web based inventory control system, possibly blazor
 * web based reporting
 * Xamarin Forms app for a mobile register



Phase 2 planning
----------------
 1. start using .NET Core - D Inject
 2. Set up task board in azure devops
 3. ci/cd with Azure DevOps
 4. Move api to Azure
 5. Database to Azure SQL
 6. Deploy to Azure Blob storage
 7. Web based inventory control
